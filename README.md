This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Haskell related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists. The `potentialBug.hs` file contains the buggy code, which may not terminate in certain cases. The `potentialBugSolution.hs` file offers a corrected version.  The issue stems from the interaction between lazy evaluation and the search for an element that may not exist in the initial part of an infinite list.  The solution addresses this by providing a more controlled way to process the infinite list and handle the case where the target element is not found.
